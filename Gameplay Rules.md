# Gameplay Rules

## Round Overview
1. Defender takes turn
2. Attacker takes turn
3. Advance Projectiles

## Player Turn Overview
1. Rotate ship
2. Change velocity
3. Move ship and loose shots

## Setup
1. The defending player places their ship with no velocity in the center hex of the map, on the White Sands Shipyard.
2. The attacking player places their ship on the edge of the map with whatever velocity they want.

## Taking a turn
1. Rotate your ship up to the rotate speed that your RCS sytstem gives you on your stat card.
2. You may add to the current numbers on your velocity counter by adding dice in the direction your main thrusters are pointed up to the amount of gees of acceleration your ship can produce. If your main engines have gimbaling, you can distribute this between two adjacent hexes on the velocity counter.
3. Resolve the velocity counter.
4. Move your ship the amount in each direction indicated by the velocity counter. You make take shots at any point during this movement. If a line drawn between your starting and final positions would encounter any objects, resolve collisons as normal.

## Advancing projectiles
For each projectile on the board:
1. If the projectile is a missle, increase its velocity by its acceleration.
1. Move in the indicated direction the indicated amount. Missles move by both their inital velocity and the velocity on their die.
2. If a line drawn between the starting and final positions would encounter any objects, resolve collisons as normal.
3. Flip the marker over, indicating it has been moved.

## Resolving the velocity counter
*When it comes to simulating spaceflight manually, simplicity is paramount. There are a few rules that you should use every time you modify your velocity counter to keep the game managable. If you follow these rules, there should never be more than two hexes on your counter in use at one time.*
1. **Opposites cancel:** If there are ever two dice opposite eachother on the counter, remove a number from each the hexes such that this is no longer true.
2. **Split dice combine** If there are ever two hexes on the counter that have dice on them that are one hex apart from eachother, remove a number from each the hexes such that this is no longer true and add that number to the hex in between them.

## Firing a shot
*Whether you are launching a missle or just inert flak, your velocity will affect that of your shots. A keen captain will take this into consideration when forming a strategy.*
1. Copy your velocity from your velocity counter to the blank one on the right side of your ship's stat sheet.
2. Add the velocity or launch velocity of the weapon you are firing to one or two adjacent hexes in a direction that the chosen weapon can fire.
3. Resolve the velocity counter.
4. Take one of the flak or missle markers marked with the velocity of the greatest value in the counter and place it in the direction indicated by the hex with the greatest velocity value on that side of your ship. Note that by choosing a marker that moves along the point of the hex grid, you have some freedom to angle your shot how you like. Make sure to place the markers such that their color matches that of the other markers currently on the board.
